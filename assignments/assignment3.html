      <p> Tofu, also known as bean curd, is a food prepared by 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_milk">coagulating soy milk</a> and then 
          pressing the resulting curds into 
          solid white blocks of varying softness; it can be silken, soft, firm, extra firm or super firm. Beyond these broad textural 
          categories, there are many varieties of tofu. It has a subtle flavor, so it can be used in savory and sweet dishes. 
          It is often seasoned or marinated to suit the dish and its flavors, and due to its spongy texture it absorbs flavours well.</p>

        <!-- Etymology -->
        <h2 id="1">Etymology</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The earliest documentation of the word in English is towfu, in a 1770 letter from the English merchant 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Flint_(merchant)">James Flint </a> 
            to Benjamin Franklin.The term "bean curd(s)" for tofu has been used in the United States since at least 1840
        </p>

        <!-- History -->
        <h2 id="2"> History </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Tofu-making was first recorded during the Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty">Han dynasty</a> about 2000 years ago.
            Chinese legend ascribes its invention to Prince Liu An (179-122 BC) of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui">Anhui province.</a> 
            Tofu and its production technique were introduced to Japan during the Nara period (710-794). 
            Some scholars believe tofu arrived in Vietnam during the 10th and 11th centuries.
            It spread to other parts of Southeast Asia as well.
        </p>

        <h3 id="2.1"> Southeast Asia</h3>
        <p>
            In Southeast Asia, tofu was introduced to various regions by Chinese from Fujian province, as evidenced by many countries 
            in Southeast Asia referring to tofu using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Nan">Min Nan</a> Chinese pronunciations for either soft and firm tofu, or "tāu-hū" and 
            "tāu-goan" respectively. In Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Vietnam, tofu is 
            widely available and used in many local dishes.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tofu is called tahu in Indonesia, and Indonesian dishes such as tahu sumbat, taugeh tahu, asinan, 
            siomay and some curries, often add slices of tofu. Tahu goreng, tahu isi and tahu sumedang are popular fried tofu snacks.
        </p>

            <tr>
                <td> <img src=../img/tofu2.jpg alt="soy curds" height="150"> <p><em>soy curds</em></p></td>

        </table>
        <p>Regardless of the product or scale of the production, the production of tofu essentially consists of:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The preparation of soy milk</li>
                <li>The coagulation of the soy milk to form curds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douhua">(douhua)</a></li>
                <li>The pressing of the soybean curds to form tofu cakes</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            It is similar to the production of dairy cheese by coagulating the milk of dairy animals to form curds and 
            pressing and aging the curds to form cheese. Typical tofu making procedures are cleaning, soaking, grinding beans in water, 
            filtering, boiling, coagulation, and pressing.
        </p>

        <h3 id="3.1">Salt coagulants</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_sulfate">Calcium sulfate </a>(gypsum) (Chinese: 石膏; pinyin: shígāo) - a traditional and most widely used coagulant to produce 
            Chinese-style tofu, it produces a tofu that is tender but slightly brittle in texture. The coagulant itself is tasteless. 
            Also known as gypsum, calcium sulfate is quarried from geological deposits and no chemical processing or refining is needed, 
            making it the cheapest coagulant used in tofu production. When used in production, the coagulation reaction is slower 
            due to its low solubility, forming a smooth, more gelatinous tofu with relatively high water content and soft texture.
            Use of this coagulant also makes a tofu that is rich in calcium. As such, many tofu manufacturers choose to use this 
            coagulant to be able to market their tofu as a good source of dietary calcium
        </p>

        <!-- Preparation -->
        <h2 id="4">Preparation</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Tofu has very little flavor or smell of its own. Consequently, tofu can be used in both savory or sweet dishes, 
            acting as a bland background for presenting the flavors of the other ingredients used. In order to flavor the tofu it 
            is often marinated in soy sauce, chillis, sesame oil, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            In East Asian cooking, tofu is prepared in many ways, including raw, stewed, stir-fried, in soup, cooked in sauce, or 
            stuffed with fillings. The idea of using tofu as a meat substitute is not common in East Asia.
        </p>
        <h3 id="4.1"> Japan</h3>
        <p>
            In Japan, a common lunch in the summer months is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiyayakko">hiyayakko</a> (冷奴), silken or firm East Asian tofu served with freshly 
            grated ginger, green onions, or katsuobushi shavings with soy sauce. In the winter, tofu is frequently eaten as yudofu,
            which is simmered in a clay pot in kombu dashi, with vegetables such as Chinese cabbage or green onion.

            <br>
            <br>

            Deep fried tofu is called atsuage (厚揚げ) or namaage (生揚げ) in Japan. The thinner variety, called aburaage (油揚げ), develops a tofu pouch often used for inarizushi.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Japan, cubes of lightly coated and fried tofu topped with a kombu dashi-based sauce are called agedashi dōfu (揚げ出し豆腐). Soft tofu that has been thinly sliced and deep fried, known as aburage in Japan, is commonly blanched, seasoned with soy sauce and mirin and served in dishes such as kitsune udon.

            In the Philippines, the sweet delicacy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taho">taho</a> is made of fresh tofu with brown sugar syrup and sago. 
            The Malaysian and Singaporean version of taho or douhua is called tofufa" or "taufufa.
            Warm soft tofu is served in slices (created by scooping it from a wooden bucket with a flat spoon) 
            in a bowl with either pandan-flavored sugar syrup or palm sugar syrup.
