          <h1>About Me</h1>

          <p class="p-font-about">
            Vera Duong is a Junior college student at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is currently studying Computer Science
            with a minor in Creative Technology and Design. Vera has a passion for developing software with cutting edge features, which ultimately she would love a career in 
            software engineering. Her first taste in this field was through her contribution to a semester-long “Google Assistant Interactive Game” 
            software development project where she collaborated with a team of four focused on utilizing Dialogflow to construct it. This enabled her to
            better her skills in SQL, NodeJS, Javascript, and HTML which helped deliver an exceptional final product.
